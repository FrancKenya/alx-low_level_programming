0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

Search algorithms are techniques used to find a specific item or information in a collection of data
There are various types of search algorithms, but two common categories are linear search and binary search.
Linear search, also known as sequential search, is the simplest form of searching. In this method, you iterate through each element in the collection until you find the target element or reach the end
Binary search is a more efficient algorithm but requires the data to be sorted. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, then the search continues in the lower half; otherwise, it continues in the upper half.

The project focuses on displaying how the search algorithms can be used in solving problems along with time complexity

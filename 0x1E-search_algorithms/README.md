0x1E. C - Search Algorithms


Overview
This project delves into the realm of search algorithms in the context of C programming. Search algorithms are fundamental to computer science and are used extensively in various applications ranging from data processing to artificial intelligence. In this project, we'll implement two primary search algorithms: Linear Search and Binary Search. Understanding these algorithms and their intricacies is crucial for any programmer, as they provide essential tools for efficiently locating elements within datasets.

Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you'll gain a solid understanding of:

What search algorithms are and their significance in computer science.
The workings of Linear Search, a simple yet effective method for finding elements in an array sequentially.
Binary Search, an efficient algorithm that operates on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
The criteria for choosing the most suitable search algorithm based on specific requirements and dataset characteristics.
Requirements
To ensure a standardized and efficient development process, we have the following requirements:

Development Environment: You should use one of the following text editors: vi, vim, or emacs.
Compilation: All code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific compiler options.
Coding Style: Adherence to the Betty style is mandatory, ensuring consistent and readable code.
Function Limit: Each source file should contain no more than 5 functions, promoting modularity and clarity.
Standard Library Usage: Only the printf function from the standard library is allowed; other function calls like strdup and malloc are prohibited.
Testing: While main.c files are provided as examples for testing functions, they are not required to be pushed to the repository. The focus is on implementing the search algorithms themselves.
Documentation: All function prototypes should be included in a header file named search_algos.h, and header files should be include guarded to prevent double inclusion.
README: A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory, containing project details, learning objectives, and requirements.
Example Questions
Throughout this project, you'll encounter various questions and challenges related to search algorithms, such as:

Implementing a function to perform Linear Search on an array of integers.
Developing a function to conduct Binary Search on a sorted array of integers.
Analyzing the time and space complexities of different search algorithms.
Understanding the trade-offs involved in selecting the appropriate search algorithm for a given scenario.

The project therefore focuses on displaying how the search algorithms can be used in solving problems along with time complexity
